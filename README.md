# What This Program Does

The only password that is not accepted is an empty one, that doesn't mean your password is good though. This program checks to see how good your password is!

It will check to see what characters are added (captial, lowercase, special characters, and numbers). Submit your password and see what happens!

# How to run the program

Open the file in any IDE and press run! It will ask for a simple input from the command line and give you a response for how strong your password is.

# Limitations

This is a very simple program and should not be used to judge important passwords. It is a simple rating system that gives a small arbitrary number based on password length and character selection.

This is not a robust program.

# Ethical Considerations

This is a program for educational purposes only. It is to test simple REGEX usage and user input from the command line. There should be no usage of this program to find the stength of other people's passwords or passwords used for very secure information.

This program should not be used to create scam password checkers or used in any malicious way.
